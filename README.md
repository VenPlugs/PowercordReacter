# Powercord Reacter

React to messages quickly by executing a command. Supports both custom emotes and default emojis.

You can also specify a name to react with all matching emotes. Supports wildcards, so `*pensive` will react with all emotes that end with "pensive", `pensive*` with all emotes that start with "pensive" and `*pensive*` to react with all emotes that include "pensive"

I made this because manually reacting is painfully laggy for me when reacting with multiple reactions very quickly
